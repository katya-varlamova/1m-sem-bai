Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Inference Python 3 Library

Fuzzython is a Python 3 library that provides the basic tools for fuzzy
logic and fuzzy inference using Mandani, Sugeno and Tsukamoto models.

Fuzzython allows you to specify inference systems in clear and intuitive way.
Those systems can be define using an extended version of the FCL language
(Fuzzython is compatible with FCL). Developers can also opt by describing
the system in the Python programming language using regular sentences for
the system rules.

Fuzzython follow the Object-Oriented paradigm ensuring sustaination and extension
of the software. The library is designed to accept easily new definitions and
extensions of fuzzy sets, norms, defuzzify methods and inference rules,
thereby facilitating the incorporation other inference models that could
be attractive in the future.
